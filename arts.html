                <p>The New York City Poetry Festival is programmed entirely by the organizations that make poetry readings happen in this city. If you would like to read at the festival, we suggest that you contact your publisher, collective, reading series, or other organization with which you are associated and encourage them to apply to host a reading at the event. If you’re just starting out and aren’t a part of a larger poetry organization, we suggest that you bring some poems and read at the Ring of Daisies open mic, which you can sign up for on site at the Information table!

        <p class="details">The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) is committed to
           advancing knowledge and understanding of the Native cultures of the Western Hemisphere—past, 
           present and future—through partnership with Native people and others. The museum works to support 
           the continuance of culture, traditional values and transitions in contemporary Native life.
           Located within the historic Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House. The museum’s permanent
           and temporary exhibitions—as well as a range of public programs, including music and dance
           performances, films, and symposia—explore the diversity of the Native people of the Americas.

        <p class="details">The Bronx Museum of the Arts specializes in contemporary art from diverse cultural backgrounds, 
           as well as art to which the Bronx itself plays a central role. Best of all, admission is free. The museum also includes 
           the XM Café, newly opened in September 2015. Easily accessible by subway, the museum is surrounded by a diverse

        <a href="https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg">Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture</a>
        <p class="details">Puerto Rican-born black scholar and bibliophile Arturo Alfonso Schomburg curated this important library
           A national research center devoted to collecting and preserving documents that reflect the experiences of people of 
           African descent throughout the world—until his death is 1938. The center’s collection first won acclaim in 1926, and 
           since then, it has grown to more than 5 million items, including manuscripts, recorded sound, photographs and prints. 
           It’s a truly unique New York institution. Located in Harlem, it is a research unit of The New York Public Library 
           system. The Center consists of three connected buildings: The Schomburg Building, the Langston Hughes Building, and the 
           Landmark Building. It is recognized as one of the leading institutions focusing exclusively on African-American, 
           African Diaspora, and African experiences.

    I wanted to put in Moma but it will only be free admission for NYC residents through October 2017
    so not an option I thought.  Team can decide.
